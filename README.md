# Algorithm Playground

This serves as the 'back-end' to the Anuglar based Algorithm Playground 'front-end'.  Algorithm solutions are provided as controller REST endpoints, to be called by the Angular app.
Each method will return data in a particular view that is easy for the Angular app to parse and transform for viewing purposes.
